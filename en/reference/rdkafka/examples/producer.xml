              Since version 4.0, proper shutdown is responsibility of the application. Please check the
              shutdown examples below the producer example. Without proper shutdown, messages can get lost.

         For a proper shutdown of the <link linkend="class.rdkafka-kafkaproducer">producer</link> we need to wait
         until all outstanding produce requests, et.al, are completed. This should typically be done [after using] a producer instance
         to make sure all queued and in-flight produce requests are completed  before terminating.

// Purge messages not yet sent to the broker (this is a safe operation to do)
$rk->purge(RD_KAFKA_PURGE_F_QUEUE);

// You can also purge messages that are inflight, not that this poses risks
// Purge messages in-flight to or from the broker.
// Purging these messages will void any future acknowledgements from the
// broker, making it impossible for the application to know if these
// messages were successfully delivered or not.
// Retrying these messages may lead to duplicates.
$rk->purge(RD_KAFKA_PURGE_F_QUEUE);

// This is highly recommended, flush waits for all outstanding producer requests to be handled
// when not using flush, you might lose messages and message errors
